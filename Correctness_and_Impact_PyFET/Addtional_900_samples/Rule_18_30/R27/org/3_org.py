def get_platform():
    """Return a string that identifies the current platform.

    This is used mainly to distinguish platform-specific build directories and
    platform-specific built distributions.  Typically includes the OS name
    and version and the architecture (as supplied by 'os.uname()'),
    although the exact information included depends on the OS; eg. for IRIX
    the architecture isn't particularly important (IRIX only runs on SGI
    hardware), but for Linux the kernel version isn't particularly
    important.

    Examples of returned values:
       linux-i586
       linux-alpha (?)
       solaris-2.6-sun4u
       irix-5.3
       irix64-6.2

    Windows will return one of:
       win-amd64 (64bit Windows on AMD64 (aka x86_64, Intel64, EM64T, etc)
       win-ia64 (64bit Windows on Itanium)
       win32 (all others - specifically, sys.platform is returned)

    For other non-POSIX platforms, currently just returns 'sys.platform'.
